I want to start first by talking about some common fears I hear from people who want to contribute
to OSS but delay in doing so. They tend to break down into a couple of distinct groups of issues
which I've attempted to categorise in the hope that they'll make them easier to discuss.

#### Feel that you have nothing to contribute

I hear of many people who really would like to help out but feel that they are not good enough
to contribute anything. This was certainly the issue I had. There are many ways to get contribute
to an OSS project though, not just by writing code. 

Most projects are crying out for people that are able to write documentation and that are
willing to maintain bug reports and feature requests. To be able to carry out these roles
all you need to do is familiarise yourself with the project you want to contribute to. If
like me you really want to help out by writing code, the previous two ways of contributing
are a really good way of transitioning into contributing via code.

#### Fear that you'll be embarrassed publicly

Another common fear is being ridiculed in public if you make a mistake, or even if you don't.
Unfortunately this fear isn't unfounded. There are examples of rude, abusive and dismissive
behaviour to be found if you search for it. Fortunately though these OSS projects and the people that
run them really are in the minority.

Fortunately you can avoid these kinds of projects by taking a look at their issue tracker and seeing
how they respond to new bug reports or feature requests. You could hang out in their IRC channel 
and see how they respond to and interact with newcomers. You could even check out responses to pull
requests that are already submitted. If you see offensive or negative comments being dished out to 
contributors, that project is likely not going to be a supportive environment for you and you should
steer well clear, there are many, many OSS project communities that are supportive and encouraging
that would love to make your aquaintance.

#### Don't know how to get started

So you've managed to research your fears away and you've found a project that you think is just
right for you, so what now? How do you get started?

Most projects want to make it really easy for people to jump right in and contribute so the first
port of call should be their Git repository, from here you should be able to fork the repository
and find details on how to set up the development environment. There should also be instructions
on how to contribute code back to the project. If no setup instructions exist and you're fairly
confident you can add them, that could be your first task!

If you just want to contribute with documentation or administration of the issue tracker then
forking the repository and setting up the developement environment will still be needed. You
then just need to familiarise yourself with the project. You will then be in a good postion to
close off issues that are stale or lack information. You'll will be able to contribute comprehensive
bug reports and provide excellent documentation for the project.

#### Why would I want to contribute anyway?

OSS isn't for everyone and it's not expected that everyone should contribute. However when I 
hear people expressing the above question, I try to respond with how OSS can contribute to them 
and their marketable skills.

For example when I started out in OSS I had a narrow set of skills mostly because my day job
works on a defined tech stack and there isn't a vast amount of scope for introducing new 
technology or techniques. OSS allowed me to explore new technology, introduced me to new ways of
working with tools that I already use in my day job and gave me the confidence to push on and
introduce changes in my day job that would improve the quality of our teams product. I also got to
network with people that I look up to within the industry.

#### In conclusion

Don't let the fear of not feeling like your good enough, or fearing that you'll be ridiculed put
you off. If you put in a little research to find the right OSS project with a team behind it that
understand the benefits of providing a supportive and inclusive environment, you'll learn new
things, meet great people and who knows, maybe open doors to things that you never thought attainable!

#### Plug

I contribute to [joind.in][joind-in] it's a great project, with a lot going on, an API, two websites
an IPhone and Android App to work on. The maintainers are excellent and really supportive so if you're
trying to find your first OSS project to contribute to check out the [joindin repository][joind-in-github].
